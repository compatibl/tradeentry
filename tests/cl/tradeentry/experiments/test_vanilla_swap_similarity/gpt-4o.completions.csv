You are tasked with evaluating the similarity between two trades in the context of a specific parameter. Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical. Pay close attention to the format and wording of the trades, but do not focus on numerical differences.

Here is the description of the basic trade:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
```

Here is the description of the trade to be evaluated:
```
Sell 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
The words Buy or Sell, or the words Pay Fixed or Receive Fixed
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing on their similarities and differences in the context of the given parameter. Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trades, but do not place emphasis on specific numerical values that may differ.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision. Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

    ""analysis"": ""The two trade descriptions differ significantly in how the parameter in question is presented: the first trade uses the terms 'Sell' directly, making it concise and to the point, while the second trade uses 'Client pays fixed', which indirectly refers to the same concept (Pay Fixed being equivalent to Buy in this context). The first trade employs a direct verb-object format ('Sell 10y SOFR swap'), while the second uses a more verbose and indirect structure ('Client pays fixed on 5y ESTR swap'), introducing the client's perspective into the description. This results in different format and phrasing styles, affecting their similarity in describing the parameter."",

Act as a Senior Quantitative Analyst tasked with evaluating the similarity in how the description of
a specific parameter is placed within the description of two different trades, so your junior colleague can be
provided an example of how to properly separate the description of this parameter from the rest of the trade.

Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical.
Pay close attention to the format and wording of how the parameter is described, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Here is the description of the first trade:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
```

Here is the description of the second trade:
```
SOFR swap, we receive fixed at 2.90%, 10y tenor
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
The words Buy or Sell, or the words Pay Fixed (which for this trade type means Buy) or Receive Fixed (which for this trade type means Sell).
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing only on the similarities and differences how this parameter is
placed within the trade description.
Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trade descriptions, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision.
Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

    ""analysis"": ""The key parameter, indicating the position on the trade (Buy/Sell or Pay/Receive Fixed), is communicated differently in both trade descriptions. In the first trade, the action 'Sell' is explicitly stated at the beginning, directly preceding the rest of the trade details. The format is straightforward: action, instrument, and terms. In contrast, the second trade describes the position as 'Receive fixed', placed after the instrument ('SOFR swap'). This format presents a more narrative structure: starting with the instrument, followed by action, then terms. The first trade opts for brevity and directness, while the second employs a slightly more detailed description with a non-linear sequence. Despite these differences, both explicitly convey the key parameter using correct terminology for the given financial context (Sell = Receive Fixed; Buy = Pay Fixed). Both adhere to clear language suitable for financial instruments yet differ significantly in their structural approach, sequential arrangement, and conciseness."",

    ""analysis"": ""The structure of the parameter descriptions in the two trades reveals differences in format and explicitness. In the first trade, the parameter (Sell) is integrated concisely at the beginning, directly preceding the details of the swap. In contrast, the second trade presents a more complex description ('Vanilla swap on 3m Term SOFR at 2.90%, we pay fixed'), where 'pay fixed' implicitly suggests the equivalent of a 'Buy' position, but this is not explicitly stated. The phrase 'we pay fixed' appears later in the sentence structure and is more verbose, indicating a contrasting approach in how the parameter is presented. Although the implication is conceptually aligned, the brevity and positioning in the first trade are notably different from the particular phrasing and implicit nature in the second, affecting the overall similarity in parameter description format."",
