Convince Package Copyright

Each individual contributor holds copyright over their contributions to the
project. The project versioning is the sole means of recording all such
contributions and copyright details. Specifying corporate affiliation or
work email along with the commit shall have no bearing on copyright ownership
and does not constitute copyright assignment to the employer. Submitting a
contribution to this project constitutes your acceptance of these terms.

Because individual contributions are often changes to the existing code,
copyright notices in project files must specify The Project Contributors and
never an individual copyright holder.
